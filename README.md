# Crowdfunding_ETL

For the ETL mini project, I practiced building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After transforming the data, Icreated four CSV files and using the CSV file data, I created an ERD and a table schema. At the end, I uploaded the CSV file datas into a Postgres database.

In the first part, I was tasked with importing the data from "crowdfunding.xlsx" and extracting its data. Once extracted, I then went ahead to clean the data and was tasked to create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames from the data and then, had to export said data as a CSV file.
